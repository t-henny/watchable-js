# watchable-js
Detect state change of custom objects and call registered observers.

Will traverse and watch the entire object chain. If new fields are added after the fact, they too will be watched.

Includes a simple `index.html` file that demos the library via console logs.

Note: This is more of a personal project than anything. There are probably other packages that accomplish this better than here ðŸ¤·.
